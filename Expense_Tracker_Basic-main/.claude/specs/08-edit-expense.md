# Step 08 — Edit Expense

## Overview

- Step 08 lets a logged-in user edit any of their own expenses via a pre-populated form at `/expenses/<id>/edit`
- The `GET` handler loads the existing expense from the database and renders the form with its current values
- The `POST` handler validates the submission and updates the row in place
- Ownership is enforced: a user can only edit expenses that belong to them
- Two new query helpers are added to `database/queries.py`: `get_expense_by_id` and `update_expense`
- The transactions table in `profile.html` gains an `"Edit"` action link per row, which requires `get_recent_transactions` to also return the expense `id`

## Depends on

- Step 01 — Database setup (`expenses` table exists with all required columns)
- Step 03 — Login / Logout (`session["user_id"]` is set and enforced)
- Step 05 — Profile page renders transactions (the edit link lives there)
- Step 07 — Add Expense (establishes the form pattern this step follows)

## Routes

- `GET /expenses/<int:id>/edit` — render edit form pre-populated with existing expense values — logged-in only
- `POST /expenses/<int:id>/edit` — validate and save updated expense — logged-in only

## Database changes

- No new tables or columns
- All required columns already exist in `expenses`: `id`, `user_id`, `amount`, `category`, `date`, `description`

## Templates

- Create: `templates/edit_expense.html`
  - Extends `base.html`
  - Form with `method="POST"` and `action="/expenses/{{ expense.id }}/edit"`
  - Fields (identical to `add_expense.html`, all pre-filled with current values):
    - `amount` — number input, `step="0.01"`, `min="0.01"`, required, pre-filled
    - `category` — `<select>` with exactly 7 fixed options, pre-selected to the current value
    - `date` — `<input type="date">`, required, pre-filled to current value
    - `description` — text input, optional, max 200 chars, pre-filled
  - Submit button labelled `"Save Changes"` and a cancel link back to `/profile`
  - Error message block that re-populates submitted (not original) values on validation failure

- Modify: `templates/profile.html`
  - Add an `"Actions"` column header to the transactions table `<thead>`
  - Add an `"Edit"` link cell per row pointing to `/expenses/{{ tx.id }}/edit`

## Files to change

- `database/queries.py`
  - Add `get_expense_by_id(expense_id, user_id)`
    - Fetches a single expense row only if it belongs to the given user
    - Returns `None` if not found or if `user_id` does not match
    - Query must scope to `id = ? AND user_id = ?`
  - Add `update_expense(expense_id, user_id, amount, category, date, description)`
    - Issues a parameterised `UPDATE` scoped to `id = ? AND user_id = ?` for ownership safety
  - Modify `get_recent_transactions`
    - Add `id` to the `SELECT` column list so templates can build edit links

- `app.py`
  - Import `get_expense_by_id` and `update_expense` from `database.queries`
  - Replace the `GET`-only placeholder at `/expenses/<int:id>/edit` with a full `GET` + `POST` handler:
    - `GET`: call `get_expense_by_id`; return 404 if not found or not owned; render `edit_expense.html` with `expense` and `categories` list
    - `POST`: read form fields, validate (same rules as Step 07), call `update_expense`, redirect to `url_for("profile")` on success; re-render form with errors otherwise
  - Route decorator must accept both methods: `@app.route("/expenses/<int:id>/edit", methods=["GET", "POST"])`

- `templates/profile.html`
  - Add `<th>Actions</th>` to the table header
  - Add an `"Edit"` link cell per transaction row

## Files to create

- `templates/edit_expense.html`

## New dependencies

- None

## Rules for implementation

- No SQLAlchemy or ORMs — raw `sqlite3` only via `get_db()`
- Parameterised queries only — never string-format values into SQL
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` must be enabled on every connection (already handled in `get_db()`)
- `get_expense_by_id` must scope its query to `id = ? AND user_id = ?` — return `None` if not found or if the ownership check fails
- `update_expense` must also include `user_id = ?` in its `WHERE` clause as a second ownership guard
- Unauthenticated access to both `GET` and `POST` must redirect to `/login`
- If the expense does not exist or belongs to another user, return 404
- Validation rules for `POST` (identical to Step 07 add expense), checked in this order:
  1. `amount`: required; must be a positive float greater than 0; parse with `float()`, catch `ValueError`
  2. `category`: required; must be one of the 7 fixed categories; reject anything else
  3. `date`: required; must be a valid `YYYY-MM-DD` string; parse with `datetime.strptime`
  4. `description`: optional; strip whitespace; store `None` if blank
- On any validation error, re-render the form with the error message and the submitted (not original) values pre-filled
- After a successful update, redirect to `url_for("profile")` — do not render the form again
- Currency must always display as ₹ — never £ or $
- Use CSS variables — never hardcode hex values
- No inline styles
- All templates extend `base.html`
- Use `url_for()` for every internal link — never hardcode paths

## Tests to write

- File: `tests/test_edit_expense.py`
- Unit tests:

| Function | Input | Expected output |
|---|---|---|
| `get_expense_by_id` | valid `expense_id` and correct `user_id` | Returns the matching row as a dict-like object |
| `get_expense_by_id` | valid `expense_id` and wrong `user_id` | Returns `None` |
| `get_expense_by_id` | non-existent `expense_id` | Returns `None` |
| `update_expense` | valid `expense_id`, correct `user_id`, `new amount=99.0` | Row in DB reflects updated amount |
| `update_expense` | valid `expense_id`, wrong `user_id` | Row in DB unchanged (0 rows affected, no error raised) |

- Route tests:
  - `GET /expenses/<id>/edit` unauthenticated → redirects to `/login` (302)
  - `GET /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, own expense → returns 200; response contains form pre-filled with current values; `<select>` has correct category pre-selected
  - `GET /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, other user's expense → returns 404
  - `GET /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, non-existent `id` → returns 404
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` unauthenticated → redirects to `/login` (302)
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, valid data → redirects to `/profile` (302); updated values reflected in the database
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, other user's expense → returns 404
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, missing `amount` → returns 200; response contains an error message
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, `amount = 0` → returns 200; response contains an error message
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, non-numeric `amount` → returns 200; response contains an error message
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, invalid `category` → returns 200; response contains an error message
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, invalid date string → returns 200; response contains an error message
  - `POST /expenses/<id>/edit` authenticated, no `description` → redirects to `/profile` (302); row updated with `description = NULL`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Visiting `/expenses/<id>/edit` while logged out redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Visiting `/expenses/<id>/edit` for a non-existent or other user's expense returns 404
- [ ] Visiting `/expenses/<id>/edit` while logged in shows a form pre-filled with the expense's current values
- [ ] The category dropdown has the correct category pre-selected
- [ ] Submitting valid changes redirects to `/profile` and the updated values appear in the transaction list
- [ ] Submitting with a missing or zero amount re-renders the form with an error and the submitted values retained
- [ ] Submitting with an invalid category re-renders the form with an error
- [ ] Submitting with an invalid date re-renders the form with an error
- [ ] Submitting without a description saves the expense with no error
- [ ] Each row in the profile transaction table has an `"Edit"` link pointing to the correct URL
